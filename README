DESCRIPTION

This is a backup program. The name hbackup has been chosen because of the way
data is stored: based on the file hash (a la git).

Why yet another backup program? Because I wanted something geared towards what
I do: software development. This system can easily be made to recognise
version-controlled directories to optimise backup choices: why backup files
that are on a server somewhere, itself with its own backup system?

SERVER CONFIGURATION

The default configuration file is /etc/hbackup.conf, and can be overriden using
the -c option. Only two keywords are acceptable there: 'db' and 'client'.
* db gives the backup database path. The default is '/hbackup'. Syntax:
  db "<path to backup database>"
* client gives the necessary information for all clients to backup. Syntax:
  client <protocol>://[<username>[:<password>]@]<hostname> "<path to list>"

CLIENT CONFIGURATION

Each client must provide its own configuration file. Four keywords may be used:
* path: start of a new backup list, gives the path information. Syntax:
  path "<path to backup>"
* compress: files to compress (for filter types, see FILTERS below). Syntax:
  compress <filter type> "<string>"
* ignore: files to ignore (for filter types, see FILTERS below). Syntax:
  ignore <filter type> "<string>"
* parser: detection of directories under version control (for existing
parsers, see PARSERS below). Syntax:
  parser "<parser name>"

COMPRESSION

Not implemented.

FILTERS

There are five types of filters:
* end: match end of path/file name
* path_start: match start of path
* path_regexp: match regular expression on path
* file_start: match start of file name
* file_regexp: match regular expression on file name

PARSERS

Only one parser is implemented at the moment:
* cvs: only backup files under version control.
